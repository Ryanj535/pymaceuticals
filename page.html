    <p>The purpose of this project was to gather, clean, sort, and visualize data from a phase 1 pharmaceutical trial <br>
      for squamous cell carcinoma. During the study, 250 mice were tested with various potential treatments over the <br>
      course of 45 days. Success was measured by tumor volume change over time, number of metastatic sites after treat- <br>
      ment, and overall lifespan of the mice after treatment.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, two of the treatments were successful, having reduced metastatic sites, as well as reduced mortality rates.<br>
      Capomulin and Ramicane had volume changes of -19% and -22% respectively. Survival rates exceeded 80% over the 45 days <br>
      in comparision to less than 60% (60% being the next highest percentage, lowest being less than 30%) survival rate in <br>
      next closest treament.
